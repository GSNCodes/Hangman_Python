# Hangman_Python
A simple Hangman game created using Python!

## Overview
This repository contains the code to a small project of mine. A simple game of hangman was developed utilizing the PyGame module.
You do have to store a set of words in the code from which one is chosen at random and is given to the user to crack.

You can set the words to choose from in the list variable `words` within the `game_play()` function.
After which, the program can be run using the command `python Main.py`
